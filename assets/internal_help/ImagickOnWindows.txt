Install Imagick on Windows...


First, download and install the real ImageMagick
https://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows

	I got ImageMagick-7.0.5-4-Q16-x64-dll.exe via HTTP method


Now, you have ImageMagick on your machine, and you need to let PHP interface with it.


On this page: https://pecl.php.net/package/imagick/3.4.3/windows
Download the Thread-Safe x64 version for your PHP (I think we all have 7.1)

Extract those files, and also open up another file explorer at the location of your PHP install.

From the extracted files...

Move php_imagick.dll into the /ext/ folder 

Move all the CORE_   . dll files into the PHP folder (not into any subfolder)



Now PHP has everything it needs to interface with ImageMagick via imagick, we just need to enable it

Open your php.ini file in a text editor

By all of the extensions around line 895, add this line

extension=php_imagick.dll

you're all set! restart your cake server and make sure you have no dynamic runtime issues.



put this in a controller to test if cake is working with it

$im = new \imagick();
debug($im->getVersion());
die;
